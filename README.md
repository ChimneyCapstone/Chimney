# Chimney

### Team Introduction
> Our team shares a desire to shorten the distance that technology creates. Team Chimney is focused on exploring the space where people and technology meet, leveraging unique and thoughtful solutions to bring humans together. We want to address the isolation that can come from living in an increasingly wired world and will make use of our varied skills and knowledge including database design and management, front-end and back-end development to create an application that closes the gaps separating us all.

### Problem Statement
> Residents in major metropolitan areas can get nearly anything they want to delivered to their homes. From dinner to detergent, books to movies, nearly anything we can think of can be brought to us at home. This is convenient and easy, but itâ€™s keeping us isolated from each other, from getting to know our neighbors and enjoying the benefits of real, human connection. While delivery will always be with us, why not get your item AND connect with your community, at the same time.
